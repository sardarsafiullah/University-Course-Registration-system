Description
This project is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)–based application that implements a course and student management system using graph data structures in C++. It models relationships between students and courses through a graph, allowing efficient organization and traversal of academic data. The project includes a C++ backend that handles core logic and graph operations, along with a simple web-based frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize and interact with the data. Designed as an academic project, it also includes detailed documentation and a presentation explaining the problem statement, implementation, and algorithmic concepts used.
